 * ### v2.0.0 breaking changes:
 *
 * - [Changes that are common for the whole library](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/upgradeGuide.md#Common-Changes).
 *
 * - The function was renamed from `distanceInWordsStrict` to `formatDistanceStrict`
 *   to make its name consistent with `format` and `formatRelative`.
 *
 * - The order of arguments is swapped to make the function
 *   consistent with `differenceIn...` functions.
 *
 *   ```javascript
 *   // Before v2.0.0
 *
 *   distanceInWordsStrict(
 *     new Date(2015, 0, 2),
 *     new Date(2014, 6, 2)
 *   ) //=> '6 months'
 *
 *   // v2.0.0 onward
 *
 *   formatDistanceStrict(
 *     new Date(2014, 6, 2),
 *     new Date(2015, 0, 2)
 *   ) //=> '6 months'
 *   ```
 *
 * - `partialMethod` option is renamed to `roundingMethod`.
 *
 *   ```javascript
 *   // Before v2.0.0
 *
 *   distanceInWordsStrict(
 *     new Date(1986, 3, 4, 10, 32, 0),
 *     new Date(1986, 3, 4, 10, 33, 1),
 *     { partialMethod: 'ceil' }

 *     new Date(1986, 3, 4, 10, 32, 0),
 *     { roundingMethod: 'ceil' }
 *   ) //=> '2 minutes'
 *   ```
 *
 * - If `roundingMethod` is not specified, it now defaults to `round` instead of `floor`.
 *
 * - `unit` option now accepts one of the strings:
 *   'second', 'minute', 'hour', 'day', 'month' or 'year' instead of 's', 'm', 'h', 'd', 'M' or 'Y'
 *
 *   ```javascript

 * - The function was renamed from `getOverlappingDaysInRanges` to `getOverlappingDaysInIntervals`.

 *
 *   ```
 *   2.1.3
 *   time interval
 *   part of the time axis limited by two instants
 *   ```
 *
 *   Also, this function now accepts an object with `start` and `end` properties
 *   instead of two arguments as an interval.

 *   or if any date in the interval is `Invalid Date`.

 *

 * @throws {TypeError} 2 arguments required

 * Notes:
 * 1. "Formatting" units (e.g. formatting quarter) in the default en-US locale
 *    are the same as "stand-alone" units, but are different in some languages.
 *    "Formatting" units are declined according to the rules of the language
 *    in the context of a date. "Stand-alone" units are always nominative singular.
 *    In `format` function, they will produce different result:
 *
 *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do LLLL', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopad'`
 *
 *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do MMMM', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopadu'`
 *
 *    `isMatch` will try to match both formatting and stand-alone units interchangably.
 *
 * 2. Any sequence of the identical letters is a pattern, unless it is escaped by
 *    the single quote characters (see below).
 *    If the sequence is longer than listed in table:
 *    - for numerical units (`yyyyyyyy`) `isMatch` will try to match a number
 *      as wide as the sequence
 *    - for text units (`MMMMMMMM`) `isMatch` will try to match the widest variation of the unit.
 *      These variations are marked with "2" in the last column of the table.
 *
 * 3. `QQQQQ` and `qqqqq` could be not strictly numerical in some locales.
 *    These tokens represent the shortest form of the quarter.
 *
 * 4. The main difference between `y` and `u` patterns are B.C. years:
 *
 *    | Year | `y` | `u` |
 *    |------|-----|-----|
 *    | AC 1 |   1 |   1 |
 *    | BC 1 |   1 |   0 |
 *    | BC 2 |   2 |  -1 |
 *
 *    Also `yy` will try to guess the century of two digit year by proximity with `referenceDate`:
 *
 *    `isMatch('50', 'yy') //=> true`
 *
 *    `isMatch('75', 'yy') //=> true`
 *
 *    while `uu` will use the year as is:
 *
 *    `isMatch('50', 'uu') //=> true`
 *
 *    `isMatch('75', 'uu') //=> true`
 *
 *    The same difference is true for local and ISO week-numbering years (`Y` and `R`),
 *    except local week-numbering years are dependent on `options.weekStartsOn`
 *    and `options.firstWeekContainsDate` (compare [setISOWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/setISOWeekYear}
 *    and [setWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/setWeekYear}).
 *
 * 5. These patterns are not in the Unicode Technical Standard #35:
 *    - `i`: ISO day of week
 *    - `I`: ISO week of year
 *    - `R`: ISO week-numbering year
 *    - `o`: ordinal number modifier
 *    - `P`: long localized date
 *    - `p`: long localized time
 *
 * 6. `YY` and `YYYY` tokens represent week-numbering years but they are often confused with years.
 *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalWeekYearTokens` to use them. See: https://git.io/fxCyr
 *
 * 7. `D` and `DD` tokens represent days of the year but they are ofthen confused with days of the month.
 *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalDayOfYearTokens` to use them. See: https://git.io/fxCyr
 *
 * 8. `P+` tokens do not have a defined priority since they are merely aliases to other tokens based
 *    on the given locale.
 *
 *    using `en-US` locale: `P` => `MM/dd/yyyy`
 *    using `en-US` locale: `p` => `hh:mm a`
 *    using `pt-BR` locale: `P` => `dd/MM/yyyy`
 *    using `pt-BR` locale: `p` => `HH:mm`
 *
 * Values will be checked in the descending order of its unit's priority.
 * Units of an equal priority overwrite each other in the order of appearance.
 *
 * If no values of higher priority are matched (e.g. when matching string 'January 1st' without a year),
 * the values will be taken from today's using `new Date()` date which works as a context of parsing.
 *
 * The result may vary by locale.
 *
 * If `formatString` matches with `dateString` but does not provides tokens, `referenceDate` will be returned.

 * @category Common Helpers
 * @summary Parse a JSON date string
 *
 * @description
 * Converts a complete ISO date string in UTC time, the typical format for transmitting
 * a date in JSON, to a JavaScript `Date` instance.
 *
 * This is a minimal implementation for converting dates retrieved from a JSON API to
 * a `Date` instance which can be used with other functions in the `date-fns` library.
 * The following formats are supported:
 *
 * - `2000-03-15T05:20:10.123Z`: The output of `.toISOString()` and `JSON.stringify(new Date())`
 * - `2000-03-15T05:20:10Z`: Without milliseconds
 * - `2000-03-15T05:20:10+00:00`: With a zero offset, the default JSON encoded format in some other languages
 * - `2000-03-15T05:20:10+0000`: With a zero offset without a colon
 * - `2000-03-15T05:20:10`: Without a trailing 'Z' symbol
 * - `2000-03-15T05:20:10.1234567`: Up to 7 digits in milliseconds field. Only first 3 are taken into account since JS does not allow fractional milliseconds
 * - `2000-03-15 05:20:10`: With a space instead of a 'T' separator for APIs returning a SQL date without reformatting
 *
 * For convenience and ease of use these other input types are also supported
 * via [toDate]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/toDate}:
 *
 * - A `Date` instance will be cloned
 * - A `number` will be treated as a timestamp
 *
 * Any other input type or invalid date strings will return an `Invalid Date`.
 *
 * @param {String|Number|Date} argument A fully formed ISO8601 date string to convert
 * @returns {Date} the parsed date in the local time zone
 * @throws {TypeError} 1 argument required
