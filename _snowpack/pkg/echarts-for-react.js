/**
 * ----------------------------------------------------------
 * [STRATEGY_MERGE] Merge properties or erase all properties:
 *
 * Based on the fact that the existing zr element probably be reused, we now consider whether
 * merge or erase all properties to the exsiting elements.
 * That is, if a certain props is not specified in the lastest return of `renderItem`:
 * + "Merge" means that do not modify the value on the existing element.
 * + "Erase all" means that use a default value to the existing element.
 *
 * "Merge" might bring some unexpected state retaining for users and "erase all" seams to be
 * more safe. "erase all" force users to specify all of the props each time, which is recommanded
 * in most cases.
 * But "erase all" theoretically disables the chance of performance optimization (e.g., just
 * generete shape and style at the first time rather than always do that).
 * So we still use "merge" rather than "erase all". If users need "erase all", they can
 * simple always set all of the props each time.
 * Some "object-like" config like `textConfig`, `textContent`, `style` which are not needed for
 * every elment, so we replace them only when user specify them. And the that is a total replace.
 *
 * TODO: there is no hint of 'isFirst' to users. So the performance enhancement can not be
 * performed yet. Consider the case:
 * (1) setOption to "mergeChildren" with a smaller children count
 * (2) Use dataZoom to make an item disappear.
 * (3) User dataZoom to make the item display again. At that time, renderItem need to return the
 * full option rather than partial option to recreate the element.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------
 * [STRATEGY_NULL] `hasOwnProperty` or `== null`:
 *
 * Ditinguishing "own property" probably bring little trouble to user when make el options.
 * So we  trade a {xx: null} or {xx: undefined} as "not specified" if possible rather than
 * "set them to null/undefined". In most cases, props can not be cleared. Some typicall
 * clearable props like `style`/`textConfig`/`textContent` we enable `false` to means
 * "clear". In some othere special cases that the prop is able to set as null/undefined,
 * but not suitable to use `false`, `hasOwnProperty` is checked.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------
 * [STRATEGY_TRANSITION] The rule of transition:
 * + For props on the root level of a element:
 *      If there is no `transition` specified, tansform props will be transitioned by default,
 *      which is the same as the previous setting in echarts4 and suitable for the scenario
 *      of dataZoom change.
 *      If `transition` specified, only the specified props will be transitioned.
 * + For props in `shape` and `style`:
 *      Only props specified in `transition` will be transitioned.
 * + Break:
 *      Since ec5, do not make transition to shape by default, because it might result in
 *      performance issue (especially `points` of polygon) and do not necessary in most cases.
 *
 * @return if `isMorphTo`, return `allPropsFinal`.

 * This method makes sense only if: (very tricky)

 * (2) Local transform props of "newPath.parent" are not at their final value but already

 *     This is currently ensured by:
 *     (2.1) "graphicUtil.animationFrom", which will set the element to the "from value"
 *     immediately.
 *     (2.2) "morph" option is not allowed to be set on Group, so all of the groups have
